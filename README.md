For exercise 1, include the code
For exercises 2.1-2.5, include the code and any images you find relevant
For 2.3-2.5 include a small comment as well explaining your results.

Finally, answer the following questions:

2.6: 
Why does y_feats have the same dimension regardless of what scale we use?

2.7:
Synthesize an image with different numbers of scales, what is the effect of having more/ less scales?
